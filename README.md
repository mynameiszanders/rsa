RSA Implementation
==================

Cryptography is really beginning to intrigue me, so this library will be my implemention of the [RSA][2] public key standard in [PHP][3]. Please note that this is *not* the same public-private keys generated for [SSH][1], as [GitHub][4] uses.

The keys generated from this library are _integers_.
